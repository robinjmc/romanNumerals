# romanNumerals

Set of katas around roman numeral conversion, one of my most disliked exercises! Roman numeral conversion has bugged me ever since trying my hand at it on my bootcamp course, so here I have decided to not only face my fear but overcome it. I've never looked at a solution but I promised my self that with some free time, determination and my trusty TDD I will solve both conversion problems. May or may not include a rant or two about said kata.
